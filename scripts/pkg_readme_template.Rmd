# SoilR: Models of Soil Organic Matter Decomposition
This is the development version of SoilR. It is a rapidly evolving version that may be less
stable than the official stable version in [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SoilR/index.html).

<!--
## News 
It is now possible to define models by fluxes. This is espeacially interesting for nonlinear, nonautonomous models
with many pools.
Check out the [Example](newStyleExample) .
-->

## Documentation
* The latest build of the package documentation can be found [here:](https://mpibgc-tee.github.io/SoilR/).
* To find examples you can also look at the [workflows](https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/TEE/software/soilr/).


## Installation
There are several options.
1. To install the latest bleeding edge commit without cloning the repository, 
you can use the `devtools`package.
If it is not installed yet type:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
```

After installing `devtools`, you only need to run

```r
devtools::install_github('MPIBGC-TEE/SoilR/pkg')
```

2. Download package file (this might be slightly older) 
  go to the [package_builds](https://github.com/MPIBGC-TEE/SoilR/blob/master/scripts/package_builds) directory
  and download the latest SoilR_\*.tar.gz file
  and install it with 
  ```r
  devtools::install_local("/path/to/the/downloaded/SoilR\*.tar.gz",repos=NULL)
  ```
  If you do not want to or cannot use ```devtools``` you can install the dependencies by copying the contents of the script
  [install_dependencies.R](https://github.com/MPIBGC-TEE/SoilR/blob/master/scripts/install_dependencies.R)

3. Clone the repository [Source](#source)
  possibly change files and install the package 
  either 
  * directly with devtools
    ```r
    devtools::install('path/to/SoilR/pkg')
    ```
  * or after building it with 
    ```sh
    R CMD build path/to/SoilR/pkg
    ```

## Source code and contributing


1. You can download the source code of `SoilR` by cloning this repository
<a name='source'></a>
```
git clone https://github.com/MPIBGC-TEE/SoilR.git
```
2. If you are already contributing and want to update a vignette or correct a typo in the documentation 
look at the [tools for package maintenance](scripts/README.md).

3. If you want to contribute new functions or repair bugs, create  a pull request.
